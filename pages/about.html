                <p class="post-info-right">Published <time datetime="2023-03-04T18:30">June 21, 2024 1:00 am</time>.</p>
                <p class="post-paragraph">Its was a busy afternoon at one of Reesor Farm Market’s strawberry fields on Thursday.
                    Normally, owner John Reesor sees about 1,800 customers a week rushing to his Markham, Ont., farm to pick strawberries.
                    But over the weekend, he got 1,200 in one single day.“People are excited,” he said.
                    In the spring, Reesor noticed something unfolding in the greenery at his fields.
                    “We started picking strawberries 10 days earlier than we were last year,” the farmer told Global News.
                    “This is probably the earliest harvest season we’ve seen on record.”
                    </p>
                <p class="post-paragraph">The mild spring and the ongoing heat wave have been pushing strawberries to fruition quick. If they’re not picked fast enough, they could be at risk of spoiling.
                    “The downside to it is that our season will probably end early. We usually like to have strawberries ready for our Canada Day long weekend.”
                    That — plus customers wanting to spend less time at his farm, away from the scorching sun.
                </p>
                <p class="post-paragraph">Summer came to a sweltering start in parts of Canada — before the season was even set to begin.
                    The season officially starts on June 21.
                    Yet, a heat dome descending on Central and Eastern Canada the past few days has sent the mercury soaring — with humidex values nearing 45 C in many communities.
                </p>
                <p class="post-paragraph last-paragraph">It’s a doubled-edged sword on both farm products and essential labour.
                    “If its too hot for someone to go out in the field to harvest, that results in crop loss,” said Hannah Kaya, a farm worker organizer at National Farmers Union.
                    More importantly, extreme heat can result in loss of life — numbers that are more documented in the United States, but sometimes neglected in Canada, said Kaya.
                    “When the temperatures are reaching 45 degrees with the humidex, it becomes a health and safety concern.”
                    In some provinces, said Kaya, it seems farmers are left to bear the brunt of a warming planet.
                    “Ontario doesn’t currently have occupational health and safety regulations that specifically address heat stress. 
                    So that means that employers are left on their own to determine what is the best safety protocol for their farm.”
